# D-Box App

D-Box, the successor to C-Box, is a reliable vault application that leverages state-of-the-art algorithms.
Compared to C-Box, D-Box offers an enhanced user experience and improved algorithms.

## Download and Install

To download the latest version of the app, please visit the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rewired-gh/d-box-app/releases).
Note that not all supported platforms have a pre-built app available.

## Cryptographic Algorithms

D-Box employs platform-specific true random algorithms and dynamically generated nonces to prevent replay attacks.
It also utilizes the most robust and time-tested algorithms with parameters ensuring sufficient safety margins for hashing passwords and encrypting data.
By using platform-specific APIs whenever possible, D-Box achieves optimal performance on nearly all devices.
